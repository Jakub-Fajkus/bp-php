\section{Introduction}
In the area of robotics, it is very important to be able to create prototypes quickly and cheaply.
For this purpose, it is beneficial to use computer models and simulation when designing the structure of the robot.
There are many ways to control the robot depending on the given requirements.
It can be, for example, controlled by instructions of an imperative language~\cite{Wolff2007}, finite state machines~\cite{Hodgins1996}, classical control theory~\cite{Mita1984} or artificial neural networks~\cite{Reil2002}~\cite{Lewis1996}.
For a fast prototyping, we can use Evolutionary Algorithms to evolve the robot control.

The problem to solve in this work is defined as follows.
We have a model of a simple robot and we want to evolve a program that is based on instructions of an imperative language.
The robot is supposed to move in a simulated environment and visit the predefined reference points.
The reference points, specified by the designer, define a trajectory the robot should follow.
The program that controls the model is being evolved using Evolutionary Algorithms and then evaluated in the Mujoco simulator~\cite{Todorov2012}.

There is a number of works using Evolutionary Algorithms to evolve controllers based on artificial neural networks~\cite{Randall1992}~\cite{Farooq2013}.
There are also works that are using Genetic Programming~\cite{Macedo2017}.
The most similar work to this one is the work of Wolff and Wahde~\cite{Wolff2007}.
They are using Linear Genetic Programming to evolve a bipedal locomotion of a humanoid model.

The research conducted in this paper is primarily motivated by~\cite{Wolff2007} where a successful evolution of
control algorithms was proposed for a specific humanoid model.
In this paper, we present an extended concept which allows evolutionary design of controllers for various creatures with a different number of legs.
The goal is to evolve a program using a very reduced introduction.
set in which several sub-programs can be evolved automatically and simultaneously in order to perform specific motions of the model.
Our approach will be evaluated using several trajectories the model should follow in a simulated environment.
The detail of the proposed system will be described in Section~\ref{sec:EvolutionOfRobotControllers}.

Here, we will describe the robot's model structure~(Figure~\ref{fig:ThreeLegDetail}).

The robot model has three legs(brown), all connected via joints with the core(blue) of the robot.
The joints are located under the purple spheres.
All of the joints are actuated and their range is limited within \ang{50}.
The core of the robot contains a head(red), that is used for calculating the distance between the robot and the reference points.
The purple spheres are used for collision detection~--~if they collide with the ground, the simulation is terminated.

\section{Linear Genetic Programming}
\label{sec:theory}
Here we will discuss a brief introduction to Linear Genetic Programming~(LGP), based on~\cite{Brameier2010}.
LGP is a special variant of the Genetic Programming~\cite{Koza1992}.

Genetic Programming~(GP) solves a modelling problem.
That means we know a set of inputs to a system and the outputs it should produce.
But we do not have the system that will compute the inputs and tell us the output.
When solving a control problem, we are looking for such a function, that will lead to the desired behavior.

In GP we are evolving computer program $P$ that represents a function: $f : I^n \to O^m$, where $I^n$ denotes the n-dimensional input data and $O^m$ denotes the m-dimensional output data.

The genotype space $G$ in GP includes all programs that can be composed of elements of a given programming language $L$.
The programming language $L$ is defined by an instruction set and a terminal set.
An interpreter translates the genotype representation into the phenotype, i.e.\ the behavior of the robot.
The phenotype is then executed and its fitness is evaluated using a software physical simulator.

The original GP uses trees that correspond to expressions from a functional programming language.
The nodes of the tree represent functions, while leaves represent input values or constants.

The Linear Genetic Programming is a variant where the programs are composed of a sequence of instructions from an imperative language or a machine code.
Each program has available a predefined set of registers that can hold constants as well as results of instructions.
Those registers are often divided into groups: input registers, output registers, and calculation registers.
The instructions are composed of an operation and one or more operands.
The operands may be registers or constants.
As the program is being executed it modifies the values of the registers, reads the inputs and writes the outputs.

\section{Evolution of Robot Controller using LGP}
\label{sec:ExperimentsSetup}
In order to evolve a robot controller, the LGP concept was combined with an evolutionary algorithm and the Mujoco simulator\cite{Todorov2012} was used to evaluate the candidate programs using a built-in interpreter.
There is a prepared scene in the simulator containing a set of reference points defining a spiral~(Figure~\ref{fig:SpiralTop}).
The robot model is given a task~(using the evolved LGP programs) to move from point to point at given order and to get as close as possible to each of them.
This way the robot moves on a predefined trajectory.

\label{fig:SpiralTop}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LGP-Based Robot Controller}
\label{subsec:lgp-basedRobotController}
The programs~(which are the subject of evolution using LGP) are composed of an application-specific instruction of the form \texttt{COPY ARG1 ARG2}, where \texttt{COPY} is the instruction name, \texttt{ARG1} is source register and \texttt{ARG2} is the destination register.
Each register has it's unique identification called \textit{index} which is used in an instruction's argument.
As the program is being executed, it copies values from input or constant registers into the output registers.

The interpreter has 11 constant registers~(indices 0–10) holding integer values from -5 to 5, 2 input registers~(indices 11–12) and 3 output registers~(indices 13–15).
The values of the input registers depend on the direction to the next reference point.
Each output register is connected with exactly one robot's joint and its value is converted into a force that is applied in the joint.

For the purposes of this work, a concept of subprograms has been introduced which works as follows.

The individual's genotype~(representing the whole program) is split into 3 smaller subprograms - \textit{init}, \textit{event} and \textit{main}.

The \textit{main} subprogram is being run in an endless loop during the simulation.
Only one instruction is executed at a time.
Period of 0.3 seconds between instructions is used.

The \textit{init} subprogram is executed at the start of the simulation and its purpose is to set the initial rotation of all robot's joints.
All instructions of the init program are executed in a single time.
After that, the main subprogram is paused for one second to give the robot's joints time to finish the rotation.

The \textit{event} subprogram is run each time the robot gets close enough to some of the reference points~(but only once for each point).
Its purpose is to change the robot's joints rotation as a preparation to move to the next reference point.
The event subprogram is executed in a single time and the main subprogram is paused as well as in the \textit{init} subprogram.

A schema of the interpreter is in Figure~\ref{fig:Interpret}.
Each 0.3 seconds an instruction from the \textit{main} subprogram is executed.
The first argument is an input or constant register index, the other one is the output register index.
A value from constant or input register is then copied into the output register.

Each of the interpreter's output registers is mapped to exactly one robot's joint.
Each time an instruction is executed, the values from the output registers are read.
The values are then used as a control signal to the simulator for each joint in the model.
A value~(control signal) holds two pieces of information.
The sign of the value is used to determine the direction of the force applied~(clockwise, counterclockwise).
The absolute value of the number is used to determine the magnitude of the force.
Based on those signals and the model parameters the simulator calculates a force that will be applied in the joint.

\subsection{Evolution of robot controllers}
\label{sec:EvolutionOfRobotControllers}
In order to design the LGP-based programs to control the robot, a simple steady-state Genetic Algorithm~(GA) was applied -- see Figure~\ref{fig:SteadyStateAlgorithm}.

The parameters of the GA are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Population size is set to 1000
	\item A steady-state population model is used~(the better half of the population is kept, the other one is replaced).
	\item The genotype length is fixed to 36 instructions.
	\item A custom genetic crossover based on the uniform crossover is used~(Figure~\ref{fig:Crossover}).
	\item The probability of crossover is 80\%.
	\item The mutation is set with 100\% probability and changes only one gene.
	\item Parent selection is implemented by a tournament of size 2.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	{\includegraphics[width=21em]{ss_algo.png}}
	\caption{
	Steady-state algorithm
	}
	\label{fig:SteadyStateAlgorithm}
\end{figure}

Each chromosome in the GA represents a single program~(a candidate controller for the robot).
The structure of the chromosome is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Genotype}.
The chromosome has fixed length~(36 genes).
It is split into three smaller subprograms(init, event, main) that have fixed lengths, too.
Each gene represents a single instruction.
The instruction is a triplet and consists of the instruction name and two numbers.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	{\includegraphics[width=21em]{genotype.png}}
	\caption{
		The structure of the genotype.
	}
	\label{fig:Genotype}
\end{figure}

The GA applies both the crossover and mutation operators which work as follows.

The crossover operates on the level of subprograms.
It is based on the uniform crossover with $p = 0.5$ but instead of swapping the genes, it swaps the whole subprograms~(Figure~\ref{fig:Crossover}).

The mutation operates on the level of genes~(instructions).
There is an 80\% chance of mutating the instruction values.
There is a 20\% chance of replacing the instruction with a new, randomly generated one.
When mutating the instruction values, there is an equal chance to mutate the first or the second argument.
When a value is mutated, it is replaced by a new value from the specified range of values.

The fitness evaluation of the candidate programs is performed as follows.
For each program, a new simulation is run.
During the simulation, the program is being executed and it controls the robot's model~(as explained in the previous section).
Every second of the simulation, the distance between the robot and each of the reference points is recorded.
The program fitness is then calculated as a sum of scores for all reference points.
A score $S$ is calculated as $S = 40 - D_{min}$, where $D_{min}$ is the minimal distance recorded between the robot and a reference point.
The minimal value of the score for each point is set to 0.
Given 9 reference points on the spiral, the maximum fitness is set to 360.
This way, the evolution maximizes the score and thus minimizes the distance between the robot and each of the reference points.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	{\includegraphics[width=18em]{crossover.png}}
	\caption{
	Here, the crossover of parents A and B resulted in offsprings C and D.
	In this case, only the init subprograms were swapped.
	}
	\label{fig:Crossover}
\end{figure}

Instead of the scoring system, one could use the method of Least squares.
But the scoring system provides a way to add another flexibility into the fitness value calculation.
This way we can, for example, assign a higher fitness value to reference points that are more distant from the center of the spiral.

\section{Results}
The evolution was run 20 times.
The typical progress of fitness values can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:FitnessGraph}.

The maximum fitness possible in the simulation was set to 360, although the simulation time was not enough to gain the maximum fitness value.
The best solution found had fitness recorded during the simulation equal to 255.9.
After all the evolutionary runs, the best solution was evaluated over longer simulation time and its fitness was equal to 330.9, which is 92\% of the maximum fitness value possible.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

%\textbf{[Paper Summary]} What was the paper about, then? What the reader needs to remember about it?
This work showed an usage of Evolutionary Algorithms for finding a program for a robot control.

The results show that the evolution successfully found a relatively good solution to the problem.
Even though the time during the simulation was limited and the robot could not finish it in given amount of time, when given enough time the best solution was able to finish the simulation successfully.
That is, in other words, the robot continued following the part of the spiral trajectory that it never saw before.
