abstract = "{\enspace}The development of techniques for autonomous navigation in real-world environments constitutes one of the major trends in the current research on robotics. An important problem in autonomous navigation is the need to cope with the large amount of uncertainty that is inherent of natural environments. Fuzzy logic has features that make it an adequate tool to address this problem. In this paper, we review some of the possible uses of fuzzy logic in the field of autonomous navigation. We focus on four issues: how to design robust behavior-producing modules; how to coordinate the activity of several such modules; how to use data from the sensors; and how to integrate high-level reasoning and low-level execution. For each issue, we review some of the proposals in the literature, and discuss the pros and cons of fuzzy logic solutions.",

abstract = "The current thrust of research in robotics is to build robots which can operate in dynamic and/or partially known environments. The ability of learning endows the robot with a form of autonomous intelligence to handle such situations. This paper focuses on the intersection of the fields of robot control and learning methods as represented by artificial neural networks. An in-depth overview of the application of neural networks to the problem of robot control is presented. Some typical neural network architectures are discussed first. The important issues involved in the study of robotics are then highlighted. This paper concentrates on the neural network applications to the motion control of robots involved in both non-contact and contact tasks. The current state of research in this area is surveyed and the strengths and weakness of the present approaches are emphasized. The paper concludes by indentifying areas which need future research work.",

abstract = "In this paper, neural network control is presented for a rehabilitation robot with unknown system dynamics. To deal with the system uncertainties and improve the system robustness, adaptive neural networks are used to approximate the unknown model of the robot and adapt interactions between the robot and the patient. Both full state feedback control and output feedback control are considered in this paper. With the proposed control, uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed loop system is achieved in the context of Lyapunov's stability theory and its associated techniques. The state of the system is proven to converge to a small neighborhood of zero by appropriately choosing design parameters. Extensive simulations for a rehabilitation robot with constraints are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.",
